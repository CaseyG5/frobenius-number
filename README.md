Math/algorithm geeks (like me) love this.

Finds the Frobenius number from a set of integers

This method builds an edge-weighted digraph and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the largest integer that cannot be obtained from a given set of integers. For example, given 3 and 5, we cannot get 7, but we can make 8, 9, 10, and so on.


Credit to my former math professor Derrick Smith (one of the greatest professors I've had) for the idea and explanation of the research paper on Frobenius numbers.
