# frobenius-number
Finds the Frobenius number from a set of integers

This method builds an edge-weighted digraph and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the largest integer that cannot be obtained from a given set of integers. For example, given 3 and 5, we cannot get 7, but we can make 8, 9, 10, and so on.
